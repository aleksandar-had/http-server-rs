# http-server-rs

This is a starting point for Rust solutions to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).

As usual, building and running this can be done using cargo

```sh
# To build, run the following command in the directory
cargo build

# To run the simple HTTP server, run the following command in the directory
cargo run
```
